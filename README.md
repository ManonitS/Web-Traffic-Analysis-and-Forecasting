## Web Traffic Analysis Using Machine Learning, Python, and Power BI

This project aims to analyze and predict web traffic trends using historical data. The analysis is performed using machine learning models built in Python, and the results are visualized using Power BI for comprehensive insights.

### Key Highlights:
- **Data Source**: The project uses web traffic data from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/web-traffic-time-series-forecasting) to train models for predicting future traffic.
- **Machine Learning**: A Random Forest Regressor model is used to predict future web traffic based on features like date, month, day of the week, etc.
- **Preprocessing**: Data preprocessing includes handling missing values, feature engineering, and data splitting into training and test sets.
- **Visualization**: The predictions and actual data are visualized using interactive dashboards in Power BI, allowing stakeholders to explore and compare key trends.
  
The project pipeline includes data preprocessing, training the model, exporting results to CSV, and creating visualizations to uncover trends and actionable insights for better web traffic management.
